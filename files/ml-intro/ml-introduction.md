This workshop spreads over 2 session and we recommend attending to both
The level is introductory.

Day 1: concepts, data preprocessing & feature engineering

This workshop is not replacing any handbook or courses, but constitute a good
jump-start with relevant vocabulary to enable further learning with online resources.
